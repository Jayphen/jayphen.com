This blog is built with SvelteKit, prerendered using [adapter-static](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static) and hosted on Vercel.

The [source is here](https://github.com/Jayphen/jayphen.com), so go ahead and peruse it. I will write more on this soon.

I am actually writing this on my phone right now via Working Copy. The blog gets prerendered and deployed on every push, so I can play around with words whenever I have my phone with me.

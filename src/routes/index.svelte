  Hi, I'm <span title="Little-known fact: Jayphen is actually my nickname; my real name is Stephen"
    >Jayphen</span
  >
</h1>
<p>
  I'm a lead web engineer at <a href="https://n26.com" target="_blank">N26</a>. I was born in
  Sydney, Australia in the 80's and settled in Vienna, Austria in the 10's
  <small>(are we calling it that?).</small>
</p>
<p>
  At N26 I am working on the web engineering team in Vienna. I am both a single contributor to the
  web banking application, and leading a team with a focus on customer communication.
</p>
<p>I don't have a lot to say right now, but maybe one day there will be a blog here.</p>
<p>For now, I'm probably more active elsewhere:</p>

  p.s. this silly little page was built with <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a>. Go
  and check it out! It's the successor to <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>, an OSS
  project that I contributed to a little bit.
